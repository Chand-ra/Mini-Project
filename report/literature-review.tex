\chapter{Literature Review}

\section{Summary of existing shortest path algorithms}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, A*, and Bidirectional Search.
		\item Preprocessing techniques: Contraction Hierarchies (CH), ALT.
		\item Real-time and dynamic algorithms.
	\end{itemize}

Refer figure \ref{fig:label}.

%\label{fig:label} % insert suitable label, this is used to refer to a fig from within the text as shown above

\section{Gaps in current approaches}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Limited scalability in dynamic graphs.
		\item Lack of flexibility for user preferences.
		\item High preprocessing overhead in large graphs.
	\end{itemize}
