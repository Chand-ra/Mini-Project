\chapter*{Abstract}


This project focuses on designing, implementing, and analyzing efficient algorithms for shortest path calculations on large-scale graphs, including social, road, and communication networks. The goal is to optimize computation time, memory usage, and scalability while ensuring high accuracy and adaptability to real-world scenarios. \\

The proposed solution combines traditional algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s and Bellman-Ford with advanced techniques such as A*, Contraction Hierarchies, and bidirectional search. \\

Publicly available datasets, including road networks from OpenStreetMap, are used to evaluate performance based on execution time, memory efficiency, and scalability. \\

Deliverables include a research report, an optimized algorithm codebase, a visualization tool for shortest path computations, performance analysis, and a discussion on strengths, limitations, and future improvements.
