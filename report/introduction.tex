	\section{Importance of Shortest Path Calulation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Efficiency in Large-Scale Systems}: In large graphs, such as road networks or the internet, finding an optimal route is essential to saving time, energy, and resources. These systems often involve millions of nodes and edges, requiring algorithms that handle complexity efficiently.
		\item \textbf{Optimization and Cost Reduction}: Many industries rely on shortest path calculations to minimize costs. For example, logistics companies use them to determine the most fuel-efficient routes for deliveries.
		\item \textbf{Road Networks and Navigation Systems}: GPS services like Google Maps calculate the shortest or fastest route to a destination based on real-time traffic data, distance, and road conditions.
		\item \textbf{Network Routing}: In computer networks, protocols like Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) rely on shortest path calculations to ensure efficient data transfer.
		\item \textbf{Social Network Analysis}: Platforms like LinkedIn or Facebook use these methods to determine the "degree of separation" between users or suggest connections.
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Objective}
	The algorithm aims to:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Accelerate shortest path queries}: The use of preprocessing optimizes search efficiency, enabling near-instantaneous path retrieval in large-scale networks.
		\item \textbf{Ensure scalability}: The algorithm is designed to handle extensive datasets, making it applicable to real-world scenarios, from urban traffic management to large-scale logistics planning.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\section{Scope}
	This project is centered on developing a \textbf{hybrid shortest path algorithm} with a focus on the following key areas:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Road Networks}: The algorithm is specifically designed for road networks, where edge weights represent dynamic attributes such as travel time, distance, or toll fees. The approach ensures efficient routing solutions in real-world transportation systems.
		\item \textbf{Scalability and Efficiency}: Given the vast size of modern transportation and logistics networks, the algorithm must be capable of handling millions of nodes and edges while maintaining optimal performance.
		\item \textbf{Preprocessing for Speed Optimization}: Since traditional shortest path algorithms are computationally expensive, the project emphasizes the role of preprocessing in reducing query response times, ensuring rapid access to route data even in complex graphs.
