\chapter{Problem Definition}

The primary objective of this project is to develop and analyze a \textbf{hybrid shortest path algorithm} that integrates \textbf{preprocessing and efficient querying} to optimize route computation in large-scale networks. \\ \medskip

Traditional shortest path algorithms, such as Dijkstraâ€™s and Bellman-Ford, while effective in small-scale applications, struggle with computational inefficiencies in massive graphs. To overcome this, our approach introduces a preprocessing stage that enhances query response time, making real-time routing feasible even in complex environments. \\ \medskip

By leveraging preprocessing, the algorithm efficiently indexes the network structure, significantly reducing computation time during query execution.
